**sparkvis** adds the necessary methods to **ggvis** to allow it to handle **sparklyr's** *tbl_spark* class data sets.  

One of the methods is a **compute_bin** variance to calculate a histogram's bins inside Spark and then collect results, thus reducing the amount of data brought over into memory.  

Implemented *ggvis* layers:

- layer_boxplot

- layer_histograms

**Limitation**: The functions only works with straigth column names not formulas, so while *~mpg* will work, *~factor(am)* will not.
