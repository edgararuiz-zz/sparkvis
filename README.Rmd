**sparkvis** adds the necessary methods to **ggvis** to allow it to handle **sparklyr's** *tbl_spark* class data sets.  

New **layer**:

- layer_raster

New **compute**:

- compute_raster

Currently implemented **layers**:

- layer_bars

- layer_boxplots

- layer_histograms

**Limitation**: The functions only works with straigth column names not formulas, so while *~mpg* will work, *~factor(am)* will not.  There is a documented workaround for that in the example document.
